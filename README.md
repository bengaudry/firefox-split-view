# Firefox Split View

SplitView is a Firefox Addon that can display two websites in a split view.

It can be found on the [Firefox Addons Marketplace]("https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/splitview/").


## How to contribute

Fork the project and clone it on your machine using

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/firefox-split-view
```

Add some modifications and then, build the extension using :

```sh
python pack_app.py
```

Then in firefox, go to [Firefox debugging page]("about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox") and click load complementary module.

Select the extension.zip that you created before and there you go.


## Generate a publishable version

Just run this command : 

```sh
python pack_app.py -p
```

And it will generate a _extension.zip_ archive that can be uploaded to mozilla addons.


## Versions handling

The version can be found in _src/manifest.json_.
The format is _x.y.z_, 
- x is the major version (currently 1)
- y is the minor version (incremented for new features)
- z if the number of fixes for the minor version
